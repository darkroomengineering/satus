- Security and integration management
- Webhook handling

**When to reference**: Integrating with Sanity, Shopify, HubSpot, or other third-party services

---

### 5. `architecture.mdc` - Architecture Patterns & Best Practices
**Purpose**: Architectural patterns, state management, routing, and code quality guidelines

**Contents**:
- Type safety (TypeScript configuration)
- State management (React state, Zustand)
- Routing & navigation (Next.js App Router, Link component)
- Metadata & SEO
- Performance (server components, code splitting, caching)
- Security (environment variables, input validation, authentication)
- Testing & debugging (unit tests, debugging tools, error boundaries)
- Code quality (linting, formatting, code organization)
- Development workflow (package manager, git workflow, client/server boundaries)

**When to reference**: Architectural decisions, state management, routing patterns, code quality

## 🎯 Quick Reference Guide

### I want to...

- **Start a new feature** → Read `main.mdc` for overview, then `architecture.mdc` for patterns
- **Build a React component** → `components.mdc`
- **Add WebGL/Three.js** → `components.mdc` § WebGL Components
- **Style with CSS Modules** → `styling.mdc` § CSS Modules
- **Style with Tailwind** → `styling.mdc` § Tailwind CSS v4
- **Use custom utilities** → `styling.mdc` § Project-Specific Custom Utilities
- **Integrate Sanity CMS** → `integrations.mdc` § Sanity CMS Integration
- **Integrate Shopify** → `integrations.mdc` § Shopify Integration
- **Integrate HubSpot** → `integrations.mdc` § HubSpot Forms
- **Manage state** → `architecture.mdc` § State Management
- **Add routing** → `architecture.mdc` § Routing & Navigation
- **Optimize performance** → `architecture.mdc` § Performance
- **Handle security** → `architecture.mdc` § Security
- **Debug issues** → `architecture.mdc` § Testing & Debugging
- **Understand React Compiler** → `main.mdc` § React Compiler & Memoization
- **Handle images** → `main.mdc` § Image Optimization
- **Dev vs prod differences** → `main.mdc` § Development vs Production

## 🔄 Migration from Old Structure

### What Changed?

**Before (7 files)**:
1. `main.mdc` - Overview
2. `components.mdc` - React components
3. `webgl.mdc` - WebGL/Three.js
4. `styling.mdc` - CSS Modules
5. `tailwind-css-v4.mdc` - Tailwind
6. `integrations.mdc` - General integrations
7. `sanity-opinionated.mdc` - Sanity-specific

**After (5 files)**:
1. `main.mdc` - Overview + cross-cutting concerns
2. `components.mdc` - React + WebGL (merged)
3. `styling.mdc` - CSS Modules + Tailwind (merged)
4. `integrations.mdc` - All third-party integrations (merged Sanity)
5. `architecture.mdc` - NEW: Architecture patterns

### Benefits of Consolidation

✅ **Reduced duplication**: React Compiler, Image optimization, Dev/Prod guidelines now in ONE place
✅ **Easier to find**: Related content is together (e.g., all styling in one file)
✅ **Better context for AI**: Fewer files means more efficient context loading
✅ **Easier maintenance**: Less jumping between files, clearer organization
✅ **Clearer separation**: Each file has a distinct purpose

## 📝 Maintenance Guidelines

### When Editing Rules

1. **Avoid Duplication**: If content applies to multiple areas, put it in `main.mdc` and reference it
2. **Use Cross-References**: Link to other sections instead of duplicating content
3. **Keep It Focused**: Each file should maintain its specific purpose
4. **Update Dates**: Update the "Last updated" date when making changes
5. **Check Dependencies**: When updating one file, check if related files need updates

### Example Cross-Reference Pattern

```markdown
<!-- In components.mdc -->
## Performance Optimization
See main.mdc § React Compiler & Memoization for optimization guidelines.
```

### Adding New Content

**Ask yourself**:
- Is this component-specific? → `components.mdc`
- Is this styling-related? → `styling.mdc`
- Is this an integration? → `integrations.mdc`
- Is this architectural? → `architecture.mdc`
- Is this cross-cutting? → `main.mdc`
